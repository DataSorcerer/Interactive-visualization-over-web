   Ireland, UK and most of the northern Europe witnessed one of the most deadly snowstorms in the recent decades. People, mostly confined to their homes, took to twitter to express their feelings, share the hardships faced or just to keep themselves updated with the developments. Civic authorities and the meteorological department made heavy use of twitter to spread awareness among the citizens and keep them abreast of latest weather conditions.     
   With this background, there are loads of tweets in period from last week of February to first week of March, 2018 that relate to the storm. These tweets are a treasure trove of information that reveal various issues faced by the people in the time of crisis. An analysis of these tweets is therefore warranted as we can better prepare ourselves should the nature decide to unleash its fury in the future.    
   This information is extracted from twitter API, preprocessed with Python scripts and then visualized with Highcharts.js and Leaflet.js
