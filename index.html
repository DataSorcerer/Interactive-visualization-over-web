                <p>
                  Your client is a small web-based software company. They sell a subscription-based product to small businesses and teams. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  At the start of each week, the CEO looks at a number of different systems to review data on:
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Weekly sales performance,</li>
                  <li>Customer support performance</li>
                  <li>Customer engagement levels</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                  She often brings parts of the data into Excel to produce charts, which are then incorporated into high-level reports for the company's investors. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  The reporting systems currently present the data in a mixture of plain text, HTML tables and an exported CSV file. You have been engaged to make the process of accessing this information smoother. They would like an interactive prototype concept contained on a single web-page. Their engineers have provided you with a sample dataset upon which to base your prototype. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  The company uses Highcharts for other administrative-system reports, and would prefer a prototype that uses this.
